              At Studio E, we are committed to creating a safe, inclusive, and respectful environment for individuals who engage with our platform or the broader Latin dance space—whether online or in person. This includes students, instructors, event organizers, and content producers. Our mission is to unlock confidence, creativity, and technical mastery for all. This is an impossible mission if we do not prioritize safety and respect for our community members.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">General Principles</h2>
            <p>We are committed to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Dance ability or background</li>
              <li>Gender identity or expression</li>
              <li>Sexual orientation</li>
              <li>Disability or neurodivergence</li>
              <li>Physical appearance or body size</li>
              <li>Race, ethnicity, or nationality</li>
              <li>Age</li>
              <li>Religion or belief system</li>
              <li>Any other protected status</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Harassment, discrimination, or abusive behavior of any kind will not be tolerated in any setting—physical or digital—affiliated with Studio E.</p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Expectations for All Community Members</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Treat others with kindness, dignity, and respect.</li>
              <li>Honor personal boundaries—verbal, physical, and emotional.</li>
              <li>Speak up or report any behavior that compromises safety or well-being.</li>
              <li>Follow through on commitments (e.g., scheduled lessons, collaborations).</li>
              <li>Seek to understand before seeking to be understood.</li>
              <li>Refrain from behavior that could be clearly perceived as manipulative or abusive. Consider if your actions were shared publicly on social media. If this thought gives you pause, take the pause and reconsider your approach.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Students</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Come prepared, on time, and ready to engage respectfully with your instructor.</li>
              <li>Communicate clearly and kindly about your learning goals, boundaries, and expectations.</li>
              <li>Report any inappropriate behavior or concerns to Studio E immediately. We have <a href="https://forms.gle/6Vn7FdYrh8FfFGvK7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-[#F94C8D] hover:underline">anonymous reporting mechanisms</a> available.</li>
              <li>Understand that instructors are professionals and must be treated accordingly—any romantic or inappropriate behavior is strictly prohibited. We ask that if any mutually consenting romantic behavior arises, you let Studio E know, as we will not encourage a teacher-student dynamic of such nature. You may continue your relationship outside of the Studio E fulfillment model.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Instructors</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Maintain professional and respectful relationships with all students. You may never initiate a romantic dynamic within the teacher-student dynamic that Studio E enables.</li>
              <li>Uphold a standard of excellence in both instruction and conduct.</li>
              <li>Never abuse the power dynamic between instructor and student. It is the responsibility of the instructor to clearly communicate when power dynamics are present so that both parties can work together to navigate the dynamic in a safe manner.</li>
              <li>Ensure that physical contact, when necessary for instruction, is clearly explained, appropriate, and consent-based. You may not touch the student for any reason until consent is provided, and it is best practice to ask for consent at the beginning of each session.</li>
              <li>Respect all students regardless of their background, level, or identity.</li>
              <li>Engage in continuing education on teaching ethics, inclusion, and body awareness.</li>
              <li>Do not offer or promote services outside the platform that violate Studio E's policies. If you would like to promote additional services, reach out to studioelatindance@gmail.com and we would love to help out.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Event Organizers</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
              <li>Ensure all in-person or virtual events provide a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment.</li>
              <li>Make a concerted effort to have an easily identifiable (pink bracelet) 'safe person' present at all events. Studio E is available to provide and designate safe people upon request.</li>

            <p>If you witness or experience anything that makes you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please take the following actions:</p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
